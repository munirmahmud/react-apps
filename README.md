# Make React Apps

All of my react applications you'll find in this repo.

## To Start

If you need any of these or think to update or add new features you can commit/comment here. You can also clone this repo or fork it so that you can track your progress in your own repo.

1. Clone it: `git clone git@github.com:munirmahmud/react-apps.git`

Each application has its own folder. If you want to run any single app, you have to follow the following steps:

1. `cd` into a folder
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn`
3. Start the React app: `npm start` or `yarn start`
